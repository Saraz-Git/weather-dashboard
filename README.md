# Weather Dashboard

## Introduction

This application is a weather dashboard that runs in the browser. User can search by city name, to see current weather and 5-day forecast, and store search history for multiple cities. It retrieves data from third-party APIs https://openweathermap.org and displays data with dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
